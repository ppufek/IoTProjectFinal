# IoT Project Final
### Final packaged version of the IoT web application 

## Spring Boot + web application generated with **Angular CLI** 9.0.2. + Maven

### Front end part of the application uses **Highcharts visualizations** within an **Angular** application where real-time data is received from the sensors attached to Raspberry Pi shield and is presented to an end user.

### The server side of the project consists of Spring application that is our RESTful web service (in this case, needed as it includes headers for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the response) and allows our app to connect to the A1 IoT Platform (_https://www.a1.digital/en-de/iot-platform-release-notes-overview/_)
